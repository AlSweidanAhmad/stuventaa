# Branding

This document describes the visual and stylistic guidelines used within the project.

## Color Usage

The application uses a restrained and consistent color palette to maintain visual clarity.

Primary colors and variations are defined through Tailwind CSS utility classes rather than custom CSS variables.

## Typography

Typography relies on the default system font stack for performance and consistency. No custom fonts are enforced at this stage.

## UI Guidelines

- Layouts favor simplicity and readability
- Spacing is handled using Tailwind utility classes
- Components avoid excessive visual complexity
- Styling decisions are centralized through utility usage rather than custom stylesheets

## Assets

All static assets such as images and logos are stored under `src/assets`. Assets should be optimized before being added to the repository.
